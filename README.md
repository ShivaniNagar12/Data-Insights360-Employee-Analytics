To create a Power BI project based on the given requirements, follow these steps:

Data Preparation:
Gather employee data containing information such as employee ID, gender, last promotion date, commute distance, job satisfaction rating, etc.
Ensure the data is clean and formatted properly for analysis.

Data Modeling:
Load the employee data into Power BI.
Create calculated columns or measures to derive additional metrics such as promotion eligibility, retrenchment status, commute distance classification, and job satisfaction rating.
Define relationships between tables if necessary.

Visualization:
Create visualizations to address each requirement:
Total number of employees.
Number of male and female workers.
Percentage of male and female workers.
Promotion eligibility status (due for promotion or not due).
Percentage of workers due for promotion and not due.
Retrenchment status (lay-off or on service).
Commute distance classification (far, close, very close).
Job satisfaction rating, represented using stars.
Design visually appealing and informative dashboards and reports.

Export Data Files:
Filter the employee data to generate separate files for employees whose promotion is due and all employees with their retrenchment status.
Export these files in a suitable format (e.g., CSV).

Publish and Share:
Publish the Power BI report to Power BI Service (if applicable) for sharing with stakeholders.
Ensure appropriate security settings are applied to control access to the report.
Share the report link or embed it in other platforms for easy access.

Documentation:
Document the data sources, data modeling process, calculations, and visualizations created in the Power BI project.
Provide user instructions or a user guide for navigating the report and understanding the insights.
